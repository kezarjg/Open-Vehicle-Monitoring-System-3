===================
Renault Zoe Phase 2
===================

Vehicle Type: **RZ2**

This vehicle type supports the Renault Zoe (PH2) ZE50 41/52kWh (2019-2024) via an OBD2 connection. Additional metrics and control functions, such as pre-climate control, are available when connected to the V-CAN instead of OBD port.

CAN security gateway & OBD port limitations
-------------------------------------------

The Renault Zoe Phase 2 has a CAN security gateway, making the OBD port normally silent. All OVMS metrics must be polled through UDS/ISO-TP, similar to OEM diagnostic software. The CAN gateway forwards these polls to the appropriate ECU.

- OVMS cannot determine if the vehicle is awake unless polling is actively triggered.
- Continuous polling drains the 12V battery.
- Due to CAN security restrictions, commands cannot be sent via OBD port. A V-CAN connection is required for remote control functions.
- The vehicleâ€™s Telematics Control Unit (TCU) requests battery statistics from the BMS, allowing OVMS to detect wake-up events.

If you want to disable or remove the TCU a V-CAN connection is absolutely neccessary.

----------------
V-CAN connection
----------------

The primary vehicle CAN (V-CAN) connects critical ECUs such as BCM, HVAC, Instrument Cluster and more. It can be connected to the OVMS module instead of OBD port connection.

A V-CAN connection enables:

- **Accurate wake-up detection** (without relying on the TCU).
- **Additional control functions** (e.g., pre-climate control, unlocking).
- **Metrics like Dashboard-SOC, Charge time remaining and estimated range** (grabbed from Zoes ECUs instead of calculation within OVMS)

---------------------------
BMS firmware recommendation
---------------------------

If your BMS firmware is **530 or lower**, enable "OVMS Energy Calculation" in the setup menu. Older firmware versions miscalculate energy values, leading to an accelerated SoH decline and extended "0 km range" driving.

For an upgrade, visit a Renault dealer with CLIP and Token access. Ensure **"COMPUTER DATA" is not rewritten after flashing** to prevent issues.
